# Copilot Best Practices for This Project

- Always use **Next.js App Router** (not Pages Router).
- Use **global styles** (e.g., `globals.css`), avoid excessive inline styles or Tailwind unless necessary.
- Prefer **functional components** with React hooks instead of class components.
- This is a **Single Page Application (SPA)**
  - All components are client components
  â€“ All data is saved to local storage, no backend server.
- Use **TypeScript** and proper type annotations for safety.
- Follow existing **project conventions** rather than introducing unnecessary new patterns.
